# External APIs

Based on the `helmgraph` Product Requirements Document (PRD), this project is a command-line tool that outputs a Cypher
file. It does not require any external API integrations for its own operation, beyond potentially invoking the local
`helm` CLI. The PRD explicitly states that the tool only reads local files and does not transmit any data.

Therefore, this section is not applicable to the current scope of the `helmgraph` project.

---

**Rationale:**
This section is skipped because the PRD clearly defines `helmgraph` as a standalone CLI tool with no external API
dependencies for its core functionality.
