# Epic List

*   **Epic 1: Core HelmGraph Functionality:** Establish the foundational service to convert local Helm charts into
    Cypher queries, generating nodes and relationships for core Kubernetes resource types and outputting a `.cypher`
    script.
*   **Epic 2: Expanded Resource & Repository Support:** Enhance HelmGraph to support remote Helm repositories and
    expand the range of Kubernetes resource types it can parse and represent in the graph.
