# Goals and Background Context

### Goals

*   Improve Operational Efficiency: Reduce the time DevOps and SRE teams spend manually analyzing Helm chart
    dependencies.
*   Enhanced Understanding: Users can successfully answer complex dependency questions about their Helm charts within
    minutes.
*   Increased Confidence: Users feel more confident in deploying changes because they can clearly visualize the
    potential impact.
*   Adoption Rate: Increase the number of unique users or teams actively using the service.
*   Processing Time: Process a standard Helm chart and generate Cypher output in under 60 seconds.

### Background Context

Kubernetes configurations, particularly when managed through Helm, often become highly complex. Existing text-based or
tabular tools struggle to visualize the intricate relationships and dependencies between resources defined within these
charts. This lack of clear visibility complicates debugging, security analysis, and general cluster management.
HelmGraph addresses this by converting Helm chart templates into Cypher queries for Neo4j, offering a powerful,
queryable, and visual graph-based representation of Kubernetes deployments. This approach aims to simplify the
understanding and analysis of networked Kubernetes applications.
