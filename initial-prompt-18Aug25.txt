*plan I want to develop a new project from scratch. I want to design a service that will allow me to examine a helm chart and convert it in to cypher query commands so that is can be loaded in to Neo4j graph database. the service should accept the name of the helm chart and use the "helm template" command to produce a manifest as an intermediate step. The through this manifest "kind" in the helm chart should be taken as a node type and each instance of this kind should be treated as a node (identified by label.name and label.namespace).
